# Private Voting Dapp

On-chain private voting. User's vote count and choice are stored on-chain in an encryted manner. Tallying happens on-chain on encrypted data, and the final tally result can be revealed (decrypted) on pre-defined conditions, such as time-bound.

The Solidity contract can be found in [`Voting.sol`](https://github.com/Inco-fhevm/Contracts/blob/main/inco_contract/voting.sol).

## Get Started

Clone the project, then run:

```bash

The dapp should run on http://localhost:5173.
